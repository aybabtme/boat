# notes

## cells (mono)

SunPower Maxeon cells are best rated.

## laminate (flexible or not?)

Off the shelf, flexible is more expensive. However, rigid solar panels use tempered glass as the front sheet, instead of PET (lesser quality panels) or ETFE (higher quality panels). ETFE has greater transparency, and better weigth properties, than glass so would theoretically be better than glass. It also requires less material (0.025mm or 0.001" thickness), and thus is also cheaper than tempered glass.

Rigid or flexible panels require EVA to glue the cells to the front and back sheets (why, not sure?).

So we'd go with flexible and find some ETFE.

Manufacturers of ETFE:
- Tefzel by DuPont
- Fluon by Asahi Glass Company
- Neoflon ETFE by Daikin
- Halar by Solvay
- Texlon by Vector Foiltec
- Dyneon by 3M
