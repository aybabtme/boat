<title>Connection To BMS Slow</title>

<h1>Connection To BMS Slow</h1>

<p>Some computers can take awhile to connect to the BMS. One common reason for this is having Bluetooth enabled. Some operating systems do not properly implement the Bluetooth protocol and thus it can take awhile for the BMS utility to determine which communication devices are connected. <br />
<br />
The symptoms of this problem are that the computer might "hang" or "freeze" for 10 or more seconds while connecting to the BMS. <br />
<br />
The solution to this problem would be to temporarily disable Bluetooth on the computer while the utility is being used.</p>
