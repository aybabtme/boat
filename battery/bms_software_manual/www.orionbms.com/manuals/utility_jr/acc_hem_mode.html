<h1>Hybrid Energy Manager Modes</h1>

<p>These modes require the <a href="acc_hem.html">Hybrid Energy Manager (HEM)</a>. There are currently several supported modes for the HEM:</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Hybrid Mode: This reverts the vehicle back to normal factory control. <br />
<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="acc_phev.html">PHEV</a> Mode: This mode will use the available electric power of the vehicle as aggressively as possible (the maximum ratings) however the gasoline engine is still active to provide additional power. It is designed to offer the maximum electric power of the vehicle without restricting the total vehicle power. <br />
<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="acc_ev.html">EV</a> Mode: This mode will exclusively use the electric drive system to power the vehicle. During this mode, no gasoline is burned. <br />
<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Glide Mode: This mode will allow the gasoline engine to shut off more regularly and is ideal for short trips.</p>
