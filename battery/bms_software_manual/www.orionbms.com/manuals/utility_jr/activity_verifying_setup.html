<h1>Verifying Setup and Hardware</h1>

<p>Before getting too far, it is important to verify several things about the target application.</p>

<ol><li>
<p><b>It is absolutely essential that the battery management system has at least one method to turn off the battery charger if one is used.</b> It is strongly recommended to achieve this by connecting the <a href="acc_sfty.html">Charger Safety Relay</a> (See: Relay Settings <em>[Link target "param_enabled_relays" not found]</em> for how to enable it). Failure to provide the BMS with a means to turn off the charger can result in damage to the battery pack should the charger fail to turn itself off by its own means. <br />
<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b>It is also essential for there to be some method for the battery management system to enforce current limits</b> either through relays (See: Relay Settings <em>[Link target "param_enabled_relays" not found]</em> or through digital communication (See: <a href="acc_canbus.html">CANBUS</a>).</p>
