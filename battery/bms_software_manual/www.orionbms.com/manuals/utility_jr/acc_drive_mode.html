<h1>Drive Mode</h1>

<p>A drive mode is a term used by the OrionBMS when in a <a href="acc_phev.html">Plugin Hybrid (PHEV)</a> application. Typically in an aftermarket PHEV application, there is a <a href="acc_soc.html">State of Charge (SOC)</a> that is reported to the vehicle which is different than the real SOC of the battery. This is done in order to maintain original vehicle behavior while still using additional electric output.</p>

<p>A typical drive mode will therefore have the following elements:
<ol><li>
<p>A reported SOC%: Typically a higher value indicates a higher average current draw in a PHEV application by the vehicle and a lower value results in lower current. The ideal value is specific to each application however. <br />
<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter/exit SOC% conditions: These are SOC% markers that indicate when a mode can be entered or exitted. This is useful for automatic mode transition when a battery depletes or becomes fully charged.</p>
</li></ol>
