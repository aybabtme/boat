<h1>Current Limit Status</h1>
<h2>Default Units: Flags</h2>
<h3>Default Length (Bytes): 2</h3>

<p>This value is provided so the reasons for why a current limit (either <a href="acc_ccl.html">Charge Current Limit</a> or <a href="acc_dcl.html">Discharge Current Limit</a> are being reduced by the BMS from the maximum allowable current. <br />
<br />
These reasons include:
<ul><li>
<p>DCL Reduced Due To Low SOC (Bit #0)</p>
</li><li>
<p>DCL Reduced Due To High Cell Resistance (Bit #1)</p>
</li><li>
<p>DCL Reduced Due To Temperature (Bit #2)</p>
</li><li>
<p>DCL Reduced Due To Low Cell Voltage (Bit #3)</p>
</li><li>
<p>DCL Reduced Due To Low Pack Voltage (Bit #4)</p>
</li><li>
<p>DCL and CCL Reduced Due To Voltage Failsafe (Bit #6)</p>
</li><li>
<p>DCL and CCL Reduced Due To Communication Failsafe (Bit #7): This only applies if there are multiple BMS units connected together in series over CANBUS.</p>
</li><li>
<p>CCL Reduced Due To High SOC (Bit #9)</p>
</li><li>
<p>CCL Reduced Due To High Cell Resistance (Bit #10)</p>
</li><li>
<p>CCL Reduced Due To Temperature (Bit #11)</p>
</li><li>
<p>CCL Reduced Due To High Cell Voltage (Bit #12)</p>
</li><li>
<p>CCL Reduced Due To High Pack Voltage (Bit #13)</p>
</li><li>
<p>CCL Reduced Due To Charger Latch (Bit #14): This means the CCL is likely 0A because the charger has been turned off. This latch is removed when the Charge Power signal is removed and re-applied (ie: unplugging the car and plugging it back in).</p>
</li><li>
<p>CCL Reduced Due To Alternate Current Limit [MPI] (Bit #15) <br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> Having one or more of these limiting reasons active is common and does not indicate that there is a problem with the battery pack or BMS.</p>
