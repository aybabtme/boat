<h1>Charger Safety Relay (SFTY)</h1>

<p>The charger safety relay (sometimes referred to as SFTY for short) is a signal line from the BMS to a battery charger that, when driven low, allows a battery charger to charge the battery pack. When this line floats high (there is no pull-up resistor on the line) the battery charger is responsible for shutting itself off immediately to prevent damaging the battery pack.</p>

<p><b>The use of this relay is strongly advised at least as a backup measure to ensure that the battery charger terminates properly to prevent damage to the battery pack</b>.</p>
