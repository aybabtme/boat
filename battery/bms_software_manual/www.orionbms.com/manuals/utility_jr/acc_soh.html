<h1>Pack SOH (State of Health)</h1>

<p>The State of Health (referred to as SOH or Battery Health) is a term that is used to describe how healthy or strong a battery pack is. Over time a battery pack's capacity and performance can degrade due to cell aging or exposure to extreme temperatures. These degradations can cause reduced capacity or reduced efficiency.</p>

<p>Typically this value is calculated based on observed capacity and nominal capacity (that is, a relationship between how much capacity is actually observed by the BMS and how much capacity the battery pack started off with when new) and the <a href="acc_intres.html">Internal Resistance</a> of the pack.</p>
